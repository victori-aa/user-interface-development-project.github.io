                    WHAT THE GOLF? isn’t just a question — it’s also a game that exploits, to excellent comic hijinx, the scientific principles of physics.

                    In addition, it oh so poetically queries — why do we only golf using golf balls? Why not cars? Office chairs? Even horses or giraffes? This is one of those rare, brilliant and absolutely hilarious gameplay experiences that doesn’t just entertain, it reminds us that innovation comes in all forms, including via a surplus of whimsy.

                    We dare you not to smile while trying to 9-iron a mobile home for a hole-in-one.
